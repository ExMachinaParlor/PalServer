**CHANGES FOR OPTIMIZATION (LOW-END)**
_____________________________
Parameter  | Description
------------- | -------------
BaseCampWorkerMaxNum = 15 | (1 -> 50) _10 - 20 is the safe range for low-end optimization of default player's operating capabilities_
BaseCampMaxNumInGuild = 10 | (3 -> 10) _adjust depending on average guild count_
ServerReplicatePawnCullDistance = 5000 | (5000 -> 15000) _lesser value, lower processing power for Summoned Pal Synchronization_
bIsPvP = False | (False / True) _HIGHLY recommend keeping this on False unless necessary / RUBBERBANDING is **HIGH-PROFILE** when active while riding Flying Pal_
